Simplify \*NIX Permissions
==========================

This package primarily provides a command-line script, ``simple-perms``, which suggests and can optionally apply
permission bits from a small set of "simple" permissions (0o444, 0o555, 0o644, 0o755, 0o664, 0o775) based on
the original file's permissions and type, as follows.

1. The basic suggested permission bits are 0o444.
2. If the file is a directory, or it has its user execute bit set, the suggested permissions are 0o555.
3. If the file has its user write bit set, then the suggested permissions are 0o644 or 0o755.
4. If the file has its user write bit set, then the suggested group write permissions (0o664 or 0o775) depend on the options:

   - No option or ``--ignore-group-write``: The suggestion is based on the original group write bit.
   - ``--group-write``: The suggestion always has the group write bit set.
   - ``--no-group-write``: The suggestion never has the group write bit set.

5. Additionally, the command-line interface allows the setting and masking of permission bits.

No changes are ever suggested for symbolic links.

The motivation for this tool comes from a few different needs, such as:

- When copying files from FAT media, they will often have 0o777 permissions
- When working on a website while having a restrictive umask, files may not be accessible to the webserver
